Lev Landau was a Nobel laureate in physics in 1962. He published his own course of theoretical physics, in which he described the main scientific theories of the Universe arrangement:

_Quantum theory_, _Relativity theory_ and _Field theory_.

But according to Landau, the most important work of his life is the _Theory of Happiness_. It is that every person must be happy. The formula of happiness consists of three terms:

_Work_, _Love_ and _Communication_ with people.

&#x20;

**Work.** Labor is the main thing in our life, and this is so obvious that it does not require any proof, otherwise we would still be climbing trees.

**Love.** Landau was very serious about love. He said to his wife: “My first duty is to make you happy. A husband cannot be happy if he has an unhappy wife.”

**Communication.** Communications with people took more time for Landau than it was stipulated in his formula. Landau had many friends and the doors of his house were not closed in the evening.&#x20;

His last words in our world were: _"I’ve lived my life not bad"._&#x20;
